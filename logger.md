We want to log a bunch of stuff. When receiving a request, we will store some basic data:

datetime
username
endpoint
tokens consumed

This should be stored in a data structure in Python. E.g., list or dict.
On a log request, if the list has nnn values, it should be appended to a CSV log file in a/the Docker volume.
That way, we won't do file writing too often, as this is inefficient and slow.
The file should be named something which includes the current date.
Each new date, we make a new file. If the file does not exist, add the headers at the top of the file.
Example of CSV structure

time,username,endpoint,tokens
<time>,paul,"GET /v1.2/athlete/104"


Log retention

Files with logs older than nnn days should be deleted.
This action can be triggered on new-day logging.
We should thus only have upto nnn log files in the log folder.
This should be able to override using an endpoint.
Endpoints

Add log value

POST /log

{
    "username": <string>,
    ...  // Required data fields for logging
}


Read retention days (nnn)

GET /retention

{
    "n": <int>
}


Update retentaion days (nnn)

POST /retention

{
    "n": <int>
}
